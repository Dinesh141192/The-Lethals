# THE LETHALS DOCUMENTATION

## Purpose and scope 

The idea of our application (Application Tracker) is based on providing users the alerts on their upcoming appointments. This application is designed to provide an effective and directed response when the appointment time is near. It is made sure that the user is well informed about the purpose of the appointment. This model overcomes one of the main problem components of a service alert application i.e. Managing multiple appointments. Moreover, it is designed in such a way that the record of all the appointments are tracked in real-time. Real-time analysis of the appointment details such as time, date and the client is being provided to the user. It will help the user to calculate and decide whether to attend the appointment or not accordingly. Business Requirements
